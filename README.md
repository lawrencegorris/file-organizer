# File Organizer
A little side project to practice my Python skillset and create a little program to sort files.
Learning to work with the Python 'os' and 'shutil' modules as well as reading/writing to files.

### Features:
- Able to sort seperate files in directories based on file extension.
  (Currently only able to log according to type, like, image, video, document, ...)
- Choose wheter or not to create a log file that shows the performed actions.

### Future Functionality
- Able to choose where the programs needs to be run based on preset options or user input.

#### Most recent update:
Added logging.

#### Past updates:
Runs in user's Downloads folder, sort into files based on general type (image, video, document, ...)
Implemented a startup screen.
